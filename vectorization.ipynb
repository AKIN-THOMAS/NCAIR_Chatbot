The growth of the digital technology sector over the past few years is a good \\nindication that this sector can serve as a catalyst for the rapid development of the \\neconomy.\\nHis Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, approved the redesignation of the \\nFederal Ministry of Communications as the Federal Ministry of Communications and \\nDigital Economy (FMoCDE) on the 17th of October, 2019.  This has clearly positioned \\nNigeria as early adopters of digital technology and it gives us a good opportunity to \\nbecome major participants in the growing global digital economy.\\nThe redesignation of the Ministry is in line with the priority areas that the Federal \\nGovernment asked the Ministry to focus on.  Among the priorities assigned to the \\nFederal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy is the Development and \\nImplemention of a Digital Economy Policy and Strategy for Nigeria.\\nThis Digital Economy Policy and Strategy document in based on the FMoCDE’s 8-pillars \\nfor the acceleration of the National Digital Economy for a Digital Nigeria.

Mr \\nPresident recognized the critical role \\nthat digital technologies can play in \\nthis process and recently approved the \\nredesignation of the Federal Ministry of \\nCommunications as the Federal Ministry \\nof Communications and Digital Economy.  \\nIn the new appellation, communications \\nrefers to the channel, digital refers to the \\ncontent and economy indicates the central \\nfocus of the entire process. \\nAccording to a 2016 Report by Oxford \\nEconomics, the global digital economy is \\nvalued at $11.5 trillion dollars or about \\n15.5% of the Global Economy.  This value \\nis expected to rise significantly within \\nthe next few years. This Digital Economy \\nPolicy and Strategy document aims to \\nprovide a plan for using digital technology \\nas a platform for stimulating growth in \\nall sectors of the economy through the \\ndevelopment of a digital economy for the \\ncountry.  \\nNigeria has the largest population in \\nAfrica, with an average age of 18 years, \\nthe biggest economy on the continent, the \\nlargest natural gas reserves and the one of the youngest populations on earth. In \\nterms of the nation’s geographic position, \\nit is located just between the central and \\nwestern parts of Africa and offers ready \\naccess to over half of the African continent, \\nrepresented by those that reside in \\nWestern and Central Africa, as well as the \\napproximately 200 million people living \\nin Nigeria.  All these indicators describe \\npotentials that can be harnessed for the \\nbenefit of the economy. However, there \\nare a number of things to be put in place \\nbefore our latent potential can drive the \\neconomy.  \\nThe first issue that needs to be addressed \\nis the Developmental Regulation pillar. \\nIt will provide support for the effective \\nregulation of the digital technology sector \\nin a way that enables development.  \\nCitizens are generally regarded to be the \\ngreatest assets in any economy and the \\nsame applies to the digital economy.  To \\ndrive the digital economy it is important \\nto develop a large pool of digitally literate \\nand digitally skilled citizens.  There is \\ncurrently no detailed data on the state \\nof digital literacy in Nigeria but data on \\ntechnology adoption , financial inclusion \\nand broadband penetration in rural areas \\nsuggest the level of digital literacy is \\nrelatively low. There is a need to support \\na programme for mass digital literacy \\nand this will be addressed in the Digital \\nLiteracy & Skills pillar.\\nThe Solid Infrastructure pillar, for example \\nbroadband penetration, is another key PREFACE', metadata={'source': 'docs\\\\ndeps.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy12issue to be addressed. A significant \\nimprovement in the current broadband \\npenetration of 35.4% is critical for the \\ndevelopment of a digital economy in \\nNigeria.  According to a study by ITU, \\na 10% increase in mobile broadband \\npenetration in low income countries yields \\nan increase of at least 1.6% in the Gross \\nDomestic Product (GDP).  The deployment \\nof fibre networks around the country will \\nprovide a veritable platform for expanding \\nbroadband access but lingering issues like \\ninconsistent Right of Way (RoW) charges, \\nreported cases of vandalisation of telecom \\nequipment and inadequate power supply \\nhave inhibited the penetration of the \\nbroadband. \\nThere is great potential for enhanced \\nbroadband penetration due to a number \\nof initiatives such as the 40 Terabits per \\nsecond (Tbps) broadband (submarine \\nfiber cable) capacity that exists at the \\nlanding point in Lagos.  However, many \\nof these initiatives are grossly under-\\nutilized due to limited distribution of fibre \\ninfrastructure to the underserved areas \\nof the country.  The deployment of fibre \\nacross the country will appreciably improve \\nbroadband penetration and will have the \\nadded advantage of crashing the cost of \\nbroadband access. The deployments of \\nthe 1st and 2nd phases of the National \\nInformation and Communication \\nTechnology Infrastructure Backbone \\n(NICTIB) will aid this process.  Another ray \\nof hope for the solid infrastructure pillar \\nis the Infrastructure Company (Infraco) \\nproject which aims to lay 120,000km \\nof fibre across the country to extend \\nbroadband networks to every Local \\nGovernment Area (LGA) of the Federation \\nthrough an Open Access Model. However, \\nall these options will be evaluated to \\ndetermine their relevance.The growth of solid digital infrastructure \\nis no doubt critical to the development \\nof the digital economy, however, it is \\nnot sufficient. A digital economy also \\nneeds other conditions to be met.  The \\nsolid infrastructure that broadband \\naccess provides will lead to the growth \\nof the Service Infrastructure pillar and \\na proliferation of digital platforms that \\nenable Government to Citizen (G2C), \\nCitizen to Citizen (C2C) and all other \\ne-commerce models.  \\nThe National e-govenment Masterplan \\nhas been adopted and is currently being \\nimplemented.  It will provide a one-stop-\\nshop for interacting with government.  It \\nwill also provide an Enterprise Architecture \\nand e-Government Interoperability \\nFramework to support platforms that \\ncan enhance interactions between \\ngovernment institutions on the one hand \\nand government and citizens on the \\nother. According to the United Nations \\nConference on Trade and Development \\n(UNCTAD), Nigeria’s e-commerce spending \\nis projected to increase to $75 billion in \\n2025 and the platforms created through \\nsupport for the service infrastructure \\npillar will play an important role in this \\nprojection.\\nThe Digital Services Development and \\nPromotion pillar aims to drive the growth \\nin the number of digtal jobs and digital \\nentrepreneurs in the country.  With \\nan average age of just over 18 years, \\nNigeria has a potential critical mass of \\n‘digital natives’ that can transform the \\ncountry into a regional and global digital \\npowerhouse. These creative Nigerians can \\nplay a key role in the creation of digital jobs \\nacross all sectors of the country; jobs that \\nare either based on ICTs or are dependent \\non ICTs.

In most countries, \\nhowever, the digital economy is constantly \\nbeing developed. \\nAccording to a 2016 Report by Oxford \\nEconomics, the global digital economy \\nis valued at $11.5 trillion dollars or \\napproximately 16% of the Global \\nEconomy.  The global digital economy is \\nalso projected to account for a quarter of \\nthe global economy in the next 10years. \\nNigeria currently does not has a large slice \\nof the global digital economy but effort \\nis being made to position the nation to \\nplay a leading role in contributing to this \\neconomy.\\nThe World Economic Forum predicts that \\nover 60% of global GDP will be digitized by \\n2022 and that over the next decade, digital \\nplatforms will be used to create close to \\n70% of new value.  Furthermore, according \\nto a Report by Ericsson titled “How \\nImportant Are Mobile Broadband Networks \\nfor Global Economic Development”, 10% \\nincrease in mobile broadband penetration \\nresults in approximately 0.6% to 2.8% rise \\nin gross domestic product (GDP).\\nGiven the wide range of adoption of digital \\ntechnology, it has become clear that \\nevery country stands to benefit from it. \\nCountries that have adopted and accepted \\ndigitalization tend to have the best \\nrewards. It is important to note, though, \\nthat countries need to adapt these digital \\ntechnologies to their specific context \\nin order to maximize the benefits. The successful and sustainable adaptation \\nof technology requires that countries \\nplay to their strengths and mitigate the \\nassociated risks.\\nGlobally, the United States, China and \\nIndia are examples of populous countries \\nwho have thriving digital economies. These \\ncountries have the largest populations \\nin their regions and Nigeria also has \\nthe largest population in Africa.  This \\nstrength can be used to an advantage in \\nthe development of a sustainable digital \\neconomy in Nigeria.\\nWith a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) \\nvalued at $397 Billion, Nigeria has the \\nlargest economy in Africa based on this \\n2017 World Bank estimate. Nigeria is \\n6th largest producer of oil and has the \\n10th largest oil reserves in the world and \\nthis sector has had a defining role on the \\neconomy of Nigeria.  However, the volatility \\nof the oil sector can have a negative impact \\non a mono-economy that is dependent \\non oil.

That is why NITD A is currently being \\nrestructured. The restructuring has seen the redeﬁnition of departmental functions and the \\nrefocusing of the operational mandate of some departments . Some departments have been \\nclassiﬁed as public-facing and tailored towards Infor mation Technolog y Governance in the industr y \\nwhile others now strictly must function as the Agency's operational arms for internal governance . \\nIn the process of the restructuring, a new department of Digital Econom y has been created in \\ncompliance with the directi ve of the Honourable Minister of Comm unications and Digital \\nEconom y, and in accord with the Agency's new vision “to proacti vely facilitate the development of \\nNigeria into a sustainable digital econom y”.
